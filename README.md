# Logistics LLC Consulting Project (Jan 22 - Apr 22)
### Overview: Engineered a hybrid cloud data solution utilizing Python and GCP including BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Batch Load, and Data Studio.
___
#### Problem 1: The customer had sales associates manually sifting through web pages to find contact information of freight carriers to meet their specific customer needs in an ad-hoc manner.
#### Solution 1: Developed Python (Selenium) web scraping code that was cleaned (Pandas, Regex) and uploaded into Cloud Storage and queried using BigQuery for Data Studio interactive dashboards.
#### Problem 2: The customer wanted to utilize data for sales to both monitor KPIs internally and reach their key accounts with an end-of-year data-driven Email marketing campaign.
#### Solution 2: Retrieved the 2021 data from customer source systems and built internal dashboards and generated an ad-hoc marketing campaign utilizing BigQuery and Data Studio.
#### Future considerations would include parameterizing ports for a more robust code as well as deploying the code using docker. Due to the low velocity of change in the source data this consideration was not invluded in the initial build.
